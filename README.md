# JunQi-battle-chess
First you need to pip install the latest version of pygame and pywin32. Then git clone this repository and enter the game by clicking the file "PLAYGAME.py"

if you encounter any problem feel free to submit an issue!
# The game needs two players, one is red and the other is black. Like other chess rules, the two players take turns to move their chess, following JunQi's specific rules:  
1. high ranking piece eats low ranking piece ('司令'>'军长'>'师长'>'旅长'>'团长'>'营长'>'连长'>'排长'>'工兵')  
2. '炸弹' destroys everything (except '军旗') and itself  
3. only '工兵' or '炸弹' can eat '地雷'  
4. the smallest ranking piece can eat '军旗'  
5. only after removing all the '地雷's, one can eat the other's '军旗'  
6. if the piece moves into the camp (the circle on the chess board), it is protected, and no one can eat it  
7. '地雷' and '军旗' cannot move  
8. normally a piece can move one step each turn, but if it is on the 'zebra line', it can move in straight line (no turning) as long as it is on the 'zebra line'  
9. By winning, one need to either i.eat up all the moving pieces of the opponent or ii.eat the opponent's '军旗'

This is my first project written in Pygame as a newbie in Python. I started learning python a few monthes ago, learning by the book Python Crash Course by ehMatthes.  
This JunQi program is a practice of my understandings of the python basics and Pygame. (I would appreciate it if you can give me some constructive advice on my code :))
  
Thanks for reading!  
I hope you get inspired!
